Automated Driving - Visual Evaluation of Drone Data

This repo holds the software designed and built for the code competition [Automatisiertes Fahren – GUI zur visuellen Auswertung von Drohnendaten](https://www.it-talents.de/foerderung/code-competition/code-competition-05-2020).

The objective of the software is to provide a GUI for analysis of images recorded from a drone footage for vehicles in a parking-lot. For the first phase, images are read into the GUI and analysis is performed using a combination of OpenCV and Tensorflow to detect vehicles and lane markings in the image. 

For the second part further analysis is to be done to extract useful information from the image e.g. distance and orientation of the vehicles with respect to the lane markings etc.

The figure below shows the current UI of the application.
